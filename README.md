# Prediction-of-Agriculture-Crop-Production-in-India

**Overview**

This project aims to predict agricultural crop production across different states in India using machine learning techniques. By analyzing factors such as cost of production, yield, crop type, cost of cultivation, area, and more, the project seeks to provide actionable insights for farmers, policymakers, and researchers.

**Project Objectives**

* To predict crop yields based on historical data and various influencing factors.
* To analyze the cost of production and yield variations across different states and crops.
* To provide insights for improving agricultural practices and policy formulation.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes the following key parameters:

* Cost of Production by State
* Yield by State
* Crop Type and Variety
* Cost of Cultivation by State
* Year
* Area Cultivated
* Decision Duration Recommended
* Produce

Data Sources: The data was sourced from Upskill Data Science Internship Project 

**Technologies Used**

* ***Programming Language:*** Python
* ***Data Manipulation:*** Pandas, NumPy
* ***Data Visualization:*** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* ***Machine Learning Models:*** SVR, XGBoost
* ***Deep Learning Frameworks:*** Keras, TensorFlow
* ***Evaluation Metrics:*** RMSE, MAE, R2 Score

**Results**

The project resulted in accurate crop yield predictions, with XGBoost outperforming other models in terms of accuracy. The deep learning models provided insights into more complex, non-linear relationships between the variables.

Key Findings:

* Variations in cost and yield by state highlight the need for region-specific agricultural strategies.
* Certain crop varieties performed better when recommended decision durations were followed.
